"""This script checks that tickets in the backlog have appropriate priority labels
For priority labels, it looks for:
- tickets with multiple priority labels
- tickets with no priority label
- tickets with a priority label that doesn't match their column
- tickets with a priority label that isn't one of the standard ones
If it finds a problem it corrects the label and sends a message to the person who made the ticket
It makes a comment on an admin ticket summarising the changes

Once a week it also checks that tickets have sizes and due dates.
If they don't, it leaves a message for the ticket owner
It mentions this on the admin ticket as well
